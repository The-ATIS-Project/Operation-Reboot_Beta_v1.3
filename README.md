# Operation-Reboot_Beta_v1.3
Reboot is a 2D adventure platformer game in which you control a small robot called HSD-34 through various abandoned places. He has been reactivated (rebooted?) in an old facility for no known reason and is now searching his origin. Along the way, many dangers and puzzles await him, which the player must avoid or solve in order to reach one of the portals that connect important points on Earth.  We developed the game with Unity, programmed in C#. At the moment we use a free tileset for the terrain and royalty free pixelart forest for the second level (which is still in development). I (Maxim) am working on our own tileset as soon as the system works.
